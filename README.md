# 🚗 PricePredictR: Price Prediction With Regression Analysis in R

Welcome to **PricePredictR**! In this project, we’ll use R to build regression models that predict vehicle prices based on their specifications. We’ll explore data, visualize relationships, and apply multiple regression techniques like linear and lasso regression. Let’s explore predictive analytics and regression modeling! 📊🚘

## 🌐 Project Overview

In this project, we’ll use a vehicle dataset containing specifications and prices to build a price prediction model. By applying regression analysis, we’ll discover how vehicle features relate to their prices. We’ll begin by visualizing the data using R’s powerful plotting libraries and then implement regression models, including linear regression and lasso regression, to predict prices. We’ll evaluate the models and compare their performance to find the best fit.
